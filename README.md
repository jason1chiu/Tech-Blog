## Description
My motivation is to have a platform where I can share my expertise, experiences, and thoughts on tech with a community of like-minded individuals. I built this project because I saw a need for a CMS-style blog site specifically for tech developers, where they can publish their content, connect with others in the industry, and build their online presence. This project solves the problem of providing a dedicated platform for tech developers to share their knowledge and experiences, and to connect with others in the industry. Through building this CMS-style blog site from scratch, I learned how to structure my code according to the MVC paradigm, use Handlebars.js as a templating engine, connect to a MySQL database using Sequelize, and implement authentication using the express-session and bcrypt npm packages.

## Usage
To use the CMS-style blog site, first visit the homepage where you can view existing blog posts and log in or sign up to create your own posts. After logging in, you will be able to access the dashboard where you can manage your posts, including creating new ones and updating or deleting existing ones. When viewing an existing blog post, you can leave a comment, and if you are logged in, your comment will be saved with your username and the date created. After a period of 30 minutes of inactivity, you will be prompted to log in again to establish a new session on the site. For safety reasons, it is important to note that your session will be automatically terminated after 1 hour of inactivity, which includes actions such as adding, saving, or updating comments and posts. By using this blog site, you can connect with other tech developers, share your expertise, and build your online presence.
